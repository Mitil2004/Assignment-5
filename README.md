Python Data Structures and Strings Assignment
This repository contains Python scripts for Assignment 5, focusing on fundamental data structures (dictionaries and lists) and string manipulation in Python.

Description
This project includes two Python scripts that demonstrate key concepts related to data structures.

Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks (task_1.py)
This script showcases dictionary usage:

It initializes a dictionary with student names as keys and their marks as values.

It prompts the user to enter a student's name.

It retrieves and displays the student's marks if they exist in the dictionary.

If the student's name is not found, it prints a "Student not found" message.

Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing (task_2.py)
This script demonstrates the power of list slicing:

It creates a list of integers from 1 to 10.

It uses slicing to extract the first five elements into a new list.

It then reverses the extracted list using a slice with a negative step.

It prints the original list, the extracted sublist, and the reversed sublist.

How to Run the Scripts
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

To run Task 1, execute the script and follow the on-screen prompts:

python task_1.py

To run Task 2, simply execute the script:

python task_2.py
